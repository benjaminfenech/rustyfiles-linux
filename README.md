# rfiles

> [!NOTE]
> rfiles is a file manager for Linux, written in Rust. It began as the Linux port of
> [rustyfiles](https://github.com/gelenmedya/rustyfiles) by Özer Güzel and got its own name
> when it stopped following upstream. The last rustyfiles release merged was 0.6.0. For
> Windows, use [rustyfiles' releases](https://github.com/gelenmedya/rustyfiles/releases).
> The history of the port is in [docs/LINUX_PORT.md](docs/LINUX_PORT.md).

rfiles has tabs, dual panes, archives you open like folders, and **DirectLook**, a
Quick Look-style previewer on <kbd>Space</kbd>. The window never waits on the disk: listing,
icons, thumbnails and every file operation run off the UI thread, so a slow network share or
a folder with 100,000 files can't freeze it. It runs on Wayland and X11.

## Install

Download the package for your system from the
[latest release](https://github.com/benjaminfenech/rfiles/releases/latest):

| System | File | Install with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Debian 12+, Ubuntu 22.04+ | `rfiles_…_amd64.deb` / `_arm64.deb` | `sudo apt install ./rfiles_*.deb` |
| Fedora | `rfiles-….x86_64.rpm` / `.aarch64.rpm` | `sudo dnf install ./rfiles-*.rpm` |
| openSUSE | the same `.rpm` | `sudo zypper install ./rfiles-*.rpm` |
| Arch, CachyOS, Manjaro | `rfiles-git-…-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst` | `sudo pacman -U ./rfiles-git-*.pkg.tar.zst` |
| Any distribution | `rfiles-….x86_64.flatpak` / `.aarch64.flatpak` | `flatpak install --user ./rfiles-*.flatpak` |

**Updates:** rfiles checks for a newer release shortly after it starts and then once a day.
When there is one, the status bar and Settings → About say so; you can turn the automatic check
off there. Clicking Install downloads the same kind of package you installed, checks its SHA-256
against the release's `SHA256SUMS`, and installs it. That list is signed with rfiles' release key
(`packaging/linux/release-key.pub.pem`, also built into rfiles), and a release whose signature
doesn't match is refused. The .deb, .rpm and Arch packages go through `pkexec`,
so your desktop asks for your password; the Flatpak goes through `flatpak install`. Restart then
opens the new version. A copy built from source only gets a link to the release.

**Arch from source:** `packaging/arch/PKGBUILD` builds `rfiles-git` from the latest
commit. Run `makepkg -si` there again to update.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benjaminfenech/rfiles
cd rfiles/packaging/arch
makepkg -si
```

**Flatpak:** installing the bundle fetches the runtime from Flathub. A file manager doesn't
work in a tight sandbox, so the Flatpak can see your whole filesystem and runs your apps,
terminals and tools on the host. Otherwise it behaves like the native packages and shares
their settings.

**Between releases:** CI builds the same packages for every commit to `main`. You can
download them from the latest [Linux packages](https://github.com/benjaminfenech/rfiles/actions/workflows/linux-packages.yml)
run if you're logged in to GitHub.

### Optional extras

Some features rely on tools you may already have installed. The .deb and .rpm recommend or
suggest them, and `pacman -Qi rfiles-git` lists them as optional dependencies.

| For | Arch | Debian / Ubuntu | Fedora |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PDF previews | `poppler` | `poppler-utils` | `poppler-utils` |
| AVIF images | `libavif` | `libavif-bin` | `libavif-tools` |
| HEIC images | `libheif` | `libheif-examples` | `libheif-tools` |
| Camera RAW photos at full quality (otherwise their small built-in preview) | `libraw` | `libraw-bin` | `dcraw` |
| Older video formats (DivX/Xvid, WMV, FLV, Theora) | `ffmpeg` | `ffmpeg` | `ffmpeg-free` |
| Mounting and ejecting drives | `udisks2` | `udisks2` | `udisks2` |
| Network locations (smb://, sftp://, ftp://) | `kio-fuse` or `gvfs-smb` | `kio-fuse` or `gvfs-backends` | `kio-fuse` or `gvfs-smb` |
| Desktop file dialogs, "Open with" | `xdg-desktop-portal` | `xdg-desktop-portal` | `xdg-desktop-portal` |
| Git status | `git` | `git` | `git` |

## What works

- **Browsing:**
  - Tabs, dual pane, and details, grid and column views, with live updates as files change.
  - Grouping, the preview pane, search, colour tags (search them with `tag:red`, or `tag:red AND work`, `tag:red OR blue NOT done`) and the Shelf.
  - Breadcrumbs, and `~` in the address bar.
  - Quick search: names, apps and browser bookmarks from Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Brave and Vivaldi.
- **Sidebar:**
  - Your XDG folders.
  - Drives, named by label or mount point. Drives that aren't mounted yet are listed and mount when you open them.
  - Network shares, under Network: every share in `/etc/fstab`, mounted or not, including `x-systemd.automount` ones.
  - Phones, tablets and cameras plugged in over USB (MTP, PTP, iPhone/iPad), under Drives. Opening one needs gvfs-mtp (phones), gvfs-gphoto2 (cameras) or gvfs-afc (iPhone, iPad); without gvfs, `jmtpfs`, `gphotofs` or `ifuse` work too. KDE alone isn't enough: kio-fuse can't mount phones.
  - Network locations from Dolphin and GTK bookmarks.
  - File servers on your local network that announce themselves over mDNS (Samba with Avahi, most NAS boxes, Macs): SMB, SFTP, WebDAV, FTP and NFS. Needs `avahi-browse` (avahi). Windows PCs that only use WS-Discovery don't show up; type `\\pc` or `smb://pc` in the address bar instead.
  - A folder tree, if you want one (Settings → Sidebar sections → Folder tree): pinned folders and drives get an arrow that opens them into their subfolders.
- **Files:**
  - Copy, move, rename and delete, with conflict answers, pause, a speed limit and undo/redo.
  - Progress on rfiles' taskbar or dock icon while files copy, on desktops that show it (KDE Plasma, Ubuntu Dock / Dash to Dock, Plank).
  - Bulk rename.
  - Share a folder on the network from its Properties (Sharing tab), through Samba's user shares like Dolphin and Nautilus: a share name, read-only or writable, guests or not. Needs Samba with user shares turned on (`usershare path` in `/etc/samba/smb.conf`).
  - The trash, shared with other file managers.
  - Copy and paste with other apps, and dragging files out to them on Wayland.
- **Looks:**
  - Icons from your icon theme.
  - Thumbnails, shared with other file managers. Videos, PDFs and documents go through your installed thumbnailers.
- **Tools:**
  - Folder sizes, remembered across restarts.
  - "Show disk usage", a treemap of what takes the space.
  - Git status, and hashes.
  - "Open with", listing the apps for the type with your default first.
  - A terminal pane under the file list (F4, "Run command here", or `>` and a command in the address bar), "Open in terminal" for your own terminal app, and "Open in editor".
- **Archives:** ZIP, 7z, RAR, the tar family and ISO open like folders, password-protected ones included. Add, delete and rename inside ZIP, 7z and tar, and create ZIP, 7z and tar.zst. [rarchive](https://github.com/gelenmedya/rarchive), rustyfiles' pure-Rust engine, does the reading.
- **DirectLook:** previews of images (JPEG XL built in, AVIF and HEIC through the tools above), SVG, PDF, video and audio with sound, text and code, archives, and a details card for everything else.
- **Properties window:** General, Details, Hashes, and a drive's page with its space and file system.
- **Desktop integration:**
  - Default file manager, including "Show in folder" from browsers and other apps.
  - Start at login.
  - A tray icon when running in the background.
  - Desktop notifications when long copies finish.
  - The desktop's own file chooser for rfiles' file pickers.
- **Network locations:** `smb://`, `sftp://`, `ftp://`, WebDAV, and `\\server\share` in the address bar, through kio-fuse (KDE) or GVfs (GNOME), with a login prompt when the server asks for one.
- **Languages:** English and 47 others. rfiles follows your `LANG`, or you can pick one in Settings → General.

## Setting up

**DirectLook and the Open/Save dialog on tiling window managers.** DirectLook and the
Open/Save dialog each open in their own window. A Wayland app can't float or position its
windows itself, so a tiling compositor tiles them unless you add a rule. Their app ids are
`directlook` and `rfiles-dialog`. The main window is `rfiles`, or
`io.github.benjaminfenech.rfiles` in the Flatpak.

```lua
-- Hyprland, Lua config (hyprland.lua)
hl.window_rule({ match = { class = "^(directlook|rfiles-dialog)$" }, float = true, center = true })
```

```bash
# Sway (~/.config/sway/config)
for_window [app_id="^(directlook|rfiles-dialog)$"] floating enable
# i3 (X11)
for_window [class="^(directlook|rfiles-dialog)$"] floating enable
```

With Hyprland's classic `hyprland.conf`, add a rule that floats and centers the classes
`directlook` and `rfiles-dialog`. The syntax depends on your Hyprland version (see
[window rules](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Basics/Window-Rules/)). Some setups already
float the Open/Save dialog, since it opens as a modal dialog.

**Quick search shortcut.** Turn on Settings → Quick search → "Global shortcut" and rfiles
asks your desktop for a shortcut through the desktop portal. KDE Plasma and GNOME 48+ ask you
to confirm the key, with Alt+Space suggested. On Hyprland you bind it in your config, using
the name that `hyprctl globalshortcuts` shows:

```bash
bind = ALT, SPACE, global, rfiles:quick-search
```

The shortcut works while rfiles is running. To keep it running with no window open, turn on
Settings → Advanced → "Keep running in the background". Without the portal, bind a key to
`rfiles --quick-search` instead (in the Flatpak,
`flatpak run io.github.benjaminfenech.rfiles --quick-search`). On Wayland quick search opens
as an overlay, so tiling compositors leave it alone.

**Searching inside files.** Start a search with `content:` (`content:quarterly budget`), or
press "Search inside files" when a name search finds nothing. If your desktop's file index is
running and covers the folder, rfiles asks it: Baloo on KDE Plasma, Tracker (LocalSearch) on
GNOME. Both also search PDFs and office documents. Otherwise rfiles reads the files itself,
which covers text files up to 64 MB and is slower in big folders.

**Search filters.** Add filters to a search, alone or with a name: `size:>10M` (also `<`,
`10M..1G`, `empty`, `large`), `modified:7d` or `created:2024` (also `today`, `yesterday`,
`2024-05`, `>2024-05-01`, `2023..2024-06`), and `type:image` (also `video`, `audio`,
`document`, `pdf`, `code`, `archive`, `folder`, `file`, or an extension like `type:rs`;
`type:image,video` for either). `holiday type:image modified:1y` finds this year's holiday
photos.

**Terminal.** <kbd>F4</kbd> opens a terminal pane under the file list, with your shell in the
current folder. "Run command here…" (right-click menu or command palette) opens it too, and `>`
and a command in the address bar (`> make`) runs the command there. The pane follows the
folders you browse to while nothing is running in it, and a `cd` typed in it takes the file
list along. Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+Shift+V copy and paste, a middle click pastes, and
Shift+PageUp/PageDown scroll back. Each tab has its own pane; F4 hides it and keeps the shell.
The shell gets `TERM_PROGRAM=rfiles`, so your shell's startup file can skip things there, for
example `[[ $TERM_PROGRAM != rfiles ]] && fastfetch`.

"Open in terminal" (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&#96;</kbd>) still opens your own
terminal app in the current folder. Settings → Advanced → Terminal picks which one. Automatic
tries `$TERMINAL`, `xdg-terminals.list`, then KDE's or GNOME's setting, then the first common
terminal it finds.

**Open/Save dialog.** With Settings → Advanced → "Use rfiles for Open and Save dialogs" on,
apps that use the desktop portal (Firefox, Chromium, GTK, Qt and Electron apps) show rfiles
when they open or save a file. The switch sets rfiles as the FileChooser in
`~/.config/xdg-desktop-portal/portals.conf`, or in your desktop's `<desktop>-portals.conf`,
and restarts the portal. Turning it off brings the previous dialog back. This needs the deb,
rpm or Arch package, which installs `rfiles.portal` for the portal; a Flatpak can't add a
portal backend. Apps that draw their own dialog without the portal, such as some Qt and Java
apps, keep it.

**Default file manager.** Settings → Advanced → "Set as default file manager" makes folders,
and "Show in folder" in browsers, open in rfiles, for your user only. Turning it off
brings your previous file manager back.

**Drives.** The eject button next to a USB stick, SD card or disc in the sidebar removes it
safely. Right-click a drive to unmount it, or to open it in GNOME Disks, KDE Partition Manager
or GParted (whichever is installed) to format or partition it; rfiles doesn't format drives
itself. Encrypted (LUKS) drives have a lock icon and ask for
their passphrase when you open them. Network shares from fstab whose server can't be reached
are marked offline. Mounting an internal disk may ask for an administrator password, which
needs a polkit agent. KDE and GNOME start one for you; on Hyprland or Sway, start one yourself,
such as `hyprpolkitagent` or `polkit-kde-agent`. Settings → Files and folders → "Show drives
as" sets how drives are named.

**Network folders.** The address bar shows network folders by their address
(`smb://server/share/…`). Turn off Settings → Files and folders → "Show network folders by
their address" to see where they are mounted instead (`/run/user/…`). Pinning a network folder
pins its address.

**Tray.** With Settings → Advanced → "Keep running in the background" on, rfiles stays in the
tray after the last window closes. KDE, Waybar, Noctalia and most bars show the icon; GNOME
needs the AppIndicator extension.

**Copy and paste with other apps** works on X11 and on Wayland compositors with data-control
(KDE, Hyprland, Sway). On GNOME's Wayland session it works inside rfiles only.

## Skipped: Windows-only

These features of rustyfiles' Windows app have no Linux counterpart, so rfiles leaves them
out:

- **Explorer integration:** DirectLook over Explorer and the desktop, the Explorer context menu and its shell extensions, `shell:` paths, Win+E.
- **Windows shell features:** jump lists, the taskbar preview, Libraries, Windows Search, OneDrive status, devices under This PC, preview handlers, `.lnk` shortcuts, the global hotkey, and the speed test against File Explorer.
- **Properties tabs:** Shortcut, Compatibility, Security (Windows ACLs), Digital signatures (Authenticode), Sharing, Customize (desktop.ini folder icons), Disk Cleanup, "Unblock", and the archive, indexing, compression and encryption attributes. Hidden is a dot name on Linux, and read-only is the write permission.
- **Prompts:** rfiles never asks for a GitHub star or a donation the way upstream does. The links are still in Settings → About.
- **Platform plumbing:** Velopack install and auto-update (rfiles has its own updater for the Linux packages), Mica, the hybrid GPU/CPU renderer and its popup-window menus, protected system files, and upstream's Direct3D video engine (rustdecoder). Video plays through rf-player and FFmpeg.

## Pending

Not done yet, roughly in order of how much they'd help:

- **DirectLook outside rfiles.** Pressing Space over other apps needs a global hotkey, which Wayland doesn't give apps directly. rfiles can register one through the portal (quick search does), but other apps don't report which file is selected, so DirectLook would have nothing to show.
- **Distribution:** an AUR package (waiting for AUR account registration to reopen), an apt/dnf repository (COPR, OBS), and Flathub. Until then, install from [Releases](https://github.com/benjaminfenech/rfiles/releases); the built-in updater handles later versions.
- **Translation review:** the texts added since the fork were machine-translated into all 47 languages. Corrections from native speakers are welcome.
- **Hand checks:** a few features have unit tests but haven't been tried by hand on every desktop. [docs/LINUX_PORT.md](docs/LINUX_PORT.md#hand-checks) lists them.

## Building and development

You need [Rust](https://rustup.rs) 1.95 or newer, a C compiler, and these libraries:

```bash
# Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel libxkbcommon-x11 wayland fontconfig freetype2 alsa-lib

# Debian / Ubuntu (what CI uses)
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libxcb1-dev libwayland-dev libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype-dev libasound2-dev
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benjaminfenech/rfiles
cd rfiles
cargo run --release -p rf-app --bin rfiles
```

**Packages:** `packaging/linux/build-packages.sh` makes the .deb and .rpm from a release
build (needs [nfpm](https://nfpm.goreleaser.com)). The Flatpak builds with:

```bash
flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build-flatpak packaging/flatpak/io.github.benjaminfenech.rfiles.yml
```

**Releases:** in a PR, set the version in `Cargo.toml`, put its tag in
`packaging/linux/RELEASE` (`v<version>`, like `v0.7.0`) and write the notes in
`packaging/linux/release-notes.md`. Once it merges into `main`, CI tags it, builds every package,
signs their `SHA256SUMS` with the `RFILES_SIGNING_KEY` secret (an Ed25519 key in PEM form) and
publishes the release. Without the secret, or with a key that doesn't match
`packaging/linux/release-key.pub.pem`, nothing is published.

**rustyfiles:** rfiles no longer merges upstream, but a cross-platform fix can still be
cherry-picked (`git remote add upstream https://github.com/gelenmedya/rustyfiles`).
[docs/LINUX_PORT.md](docs/LINUX_PORT.md) logs the merges up to 0.6.0.

**Settings** are stored in `~/.config/rfiles/settings.toml`, and DirectLook's in
`directlook.toml` next to it.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `RFILES_CONFIG_DIR` = folder | Keep settings in another folder (portable use, tests) |
| `RFILES_MULTI_INSTANCE=1` | Allow several copies at once (tests) |
| `RFILES_LOOK_INSTANCE` = name | A separate DirectLook instance (tests) |
| `RFILES_FRAME_LOG=1` | Log frame times |
| `RFILES_LOOK_TRACE=1` | Log DirectLook's timings to stderr |
| `RFILES_MUTE=1` | DirectLook plays without sound (tests) |

| Crate | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `crates/rf-app` | The interface, and the two programs: `rfiles` and `directlook` (`src/look/`) |
| `crates/rf-linux` | The Linux platform layer: files, drives, trash, icons, thumbnails, the desktop |
| `crates/rf-core` | The model: locations, history, entries, formatting |
| `crates/rf-archive` | Archive operations: browse, extract, create, edit |
| `crates/rf-player` | DirectLook's video and audio player |

The interface is built with [GPUI](https://gpui.rs), the framework behind the Zed editor.

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome.
